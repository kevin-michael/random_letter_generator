Python programm which opens an interactive window for creating random letters (inlcuding special charackters like umlauts).
Just launch the code via terminal, console or IDE (whatever you like).
Descriptions within in the code are in german.
The IcoZilla.ico file is a random icon which can be used in the code. By some minor changes this can also be excluded or replaced.
